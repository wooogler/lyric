export const defaultInputText = `Modern organizations frequently rely on chat-based platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Discord) for day-to-day communication and decision-making. As conversations evolve, organizational knowledge can get buried, prompting repeated searches and discussions. While maintaining shared documents, such as Wiki articles for the organization, offers a partial solution, it requires manual and timely efforts to keep it up to date, and it may not effectively preserve the social and contextual aspect of prior discussions. Moreover, reaching a consensus on document updates with relevant stakeholders can be time-consuming and complex. To address these challenges, we introduce CHOIR (Chat-based Helper for Organizational Intelligence Repository), a chatbot that integrates seamlessly with chat platforms. CHOIR automatically identifies and proposes edits to related documents, initiates discussions with relevant team members, and preserves contextual revision histories. By embedding knowledge management directly into chat environments and leveraging LLMs, CHOIR simplifies manual updates and supports consensus-driven editing based on maintained context with revision histories. We plan to design, deploy, and evaluate CHOIR in the context of maintaining an organizational memory for a research lab. We describe the chatbot's motivation, design, and early implementation to show how CHOIR streamlines collaborative document management.`;
